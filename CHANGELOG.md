CHANGELOG
=========

#### **10-Dec-2024**

Another minor regression fix: in the C code generator, attribute and bindslot
defines now include the `@module` tag again, this can be used to avoid name
conflicts across shader files.

See issue https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/160 and PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/161
for details!

#### **09-Nov-2024**

Important regression fix: shaders which used textures/samplers both on the vertex-
and fragment-stage didn't code-generate the correct `sg_shader_desc.image_sampler_pairs[]`
array which then causes validation errors in sokol_gfx.h and general breakage when
using the GL backend.

See https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/154 for details.

#### **07-Nov-2024**

This is the sokol-shdc update going with the sokol-gfx 'bindings cleanup update':

- Input shader code now require explicit `layout(binding=N)` annotations on
  uniform blocks, textures, samplers and storage buffers.
- All code generators have been updated for the new `sg_shader_desc` struct
  interior (this also affects the yaml generator output).

Associated PR: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/151

See also the [sokol repository changelog](https://github.com/floooh/sokol/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#07-nov-2024)
for more details.

#### **04-Sep-2024**

The Zig code generator (`-f sokol_zig`) now generates runtime reflection functions
when the cmdline arg `--reflection` is present.

See issue https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/117 and PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/147.

Many thanks to @Interrupt for the implementation!

#### **03-Sep-2024**

Merged PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/146 which adds more detailed
uniform block reflection info the the `bare_yaml` output's YAML file.

Many thanks to @Interrupt for the PR!

#### **13-Aug-2024**

Fixed a regression for an 'undocumented feature' (matrix vertex attributes).

For details see issue https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/141 and
PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/142.

Many thanks to @danielchasehooper for reporting the issue!

...and fixed another regression in the YAML reflection output. See
PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/143 for details.

Many thanks to @allcreater for the PR!

#### **05-Aug-2024**

A Jai code generator has been added courtesy of @NEO97online (see PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/137).

#### **01-Jul-2024**

Fix a regression from the May-2024 refactoring:

Linking the same vertex shader in different programs would generate duplicate
vertex attribute slot defines/constants. While this isn't a problem in C/C++,
other languages would error on the duplicate constants.

With the fix, vertex attribute slot constants are now unique. There's also
a more tight validation in this new vertex attribute merge step which leads
to an error if a conflict is detected between two vertex attributes that should
be identical. This validation should never fail though, if it does, it would
point to an internal bug (the associated error message is `conflicting vertex shader attributes found for '[snippet_name]/[attr_name]`).

For more details see PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/134/files and issue https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/133.

#### **24-Jun-2024**

- Minor fix in the Odin code generator (see: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/132)

#### **17-Jun-2024**

- Merged PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/130, this prints error messages to stderr
  instead of stdout.
- Fixed https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/131, error message parsing was confused
  by the extra colon of absolute Windows path names.

#### **17-May-2024**

Merged bugfix PR https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/129, this fixes the discrepancy between
a 'max storage buffers per shader stage' constant in sokol-shdc and sokol_gfx.h. Many thanks to @jdah
for the fix!

#### **12-May-2024**

A new code generator for the D language bindings via `-f sokol_d`. Note that the actual D bindings are
still WIP and haven't been released yet. Many thanks to @kassane for the initial D code generator!

#### **10-May-2024**

A minor regression in the YAML output has been fixed (wrong indentation after storage blocks), see
https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/127 for details.

#### **09-May-2024**

This sokol-shdc update goes along with the sokol_gfx.h 'storage buffer update'. It's
now possible to access readonly [Shader Storage Buffer Objects](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Shader_Storage_Buffer_Object)
in shaders.

For a general overview about the new storage buffer feature and shader authoring tips,
please see [this blog post](https://floooh.github.io/2024/05/06/sokol-storage-buffers.html).

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- the target shading languages `glsl100` and `glsl330` have been removed
  (glsl100 was overdue because GLES2 support was dropped quite a while ago
  in sokol_gfx.h, and it turned out that feeding glsl100 shaders into WebGL2 may cause some weird bugs: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/119
- the C code generation mode `sokol_decl` has been removed


**NEW FEATURES**

- the target shading languages `glsl410` and `glsl430` have been added. `glsl430` is needed for
  storage buffer support, and `glsl410` is needed as fallback on the macOS GL backend
- it's now possible to declare and access (readonly) shader storage buffer objects in shaders
- ...along with code generation which exposes the interface block struct to the C side

**BUG FIXES**

- SPIRVCross errors are now properly surfaced by enabling C++ exceptions, catching them and converting
  them into proper errors and warnings. Previously when SPIRVCross emitted an error, sokol-shdc
  appeared to have crashed (see for instance: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/124)
- line numbers for errors and warnings are now correct again (https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/103)
- a couple of smaller code generation bugs in the CPU language generators have been fixed

**OTHER CHANGES**

A massive refactoring which touches almost all code, for the following reasons:

- extracting reflection information now gets the proper 'code focus' it deserves,
  and hopefully adding new reflection features will become easier in the future
- CPU language code generators have been entirely restructured. Those are now subclasses
  of a `Generator` toplevel class which calls smaller-scale virtual methods in subclasses,
  while I'm usually not a big fan of such an OOP style approach, it gives a better idea
  what code needs to be written for adding a new output language, and it also saves
  a couple hundred lines per code generator.
- the code which decorates matrices as column-major has been removed, this seems to be a
  no-op (tbh I don't remember why this code existed in the first place, it might have been
  required in a very old SPIRVCross versions, or simply a brainfart on my part)

Unfortunately such a big refactoring might also have introduced new bugs and regressions.

In that case, please don't hesitate to write tickets: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues

#### **12-Feb-2024**

Fixed a confusing behaviour when writing conditional shader code via
`#if` vs `#ifdef`. Previously, when a shader is compiled it would get
an implicit definition block at the start looking like this:

```
#define SOKOL_GLSL (1)
#define SOKOL_HLSL (0)
#define SOKOL_MSL (0)
#define SOKOL_WGSL (0)
```

...meaning an `#ifdef` would always trigger and only `#if` had worked.

Now only the define for the current output language is present, so that
both `#if` and `#ifdef` works.

#### **29-Oct-2023**

Fix a reflection parsing regression that was introduced in the last
update (see: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues/109).

The fix avoids having to deal with 'dummy samplers' when parsing reflection
information for HLSL, WGSL and MSL by using a common GLSL output
for parsing reflection data instead of using the HLSL, WGSL and MSL
output.

PR: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/pull/110

#### **18-Oct-2023**

> NOTE: this update is required for WebGPU backend update of sokol-gfx!

This update officially introduces WGSL output for the sokol-gfx WebGPU backend
via `-f wgsl`.

Two new 'meta-tags' have been added to provide texture- and sampler-hints
for WebGPU which can't be inferred from the shader code:

`@image_sample_type [tex] [type]`: provides an image-sample-type hint for the
texture named `tex`, corresponds with the sokol_gfx.h type
`sg_image_sample_type` and the WebGPU type `WGPUTextureSampleType`. Valid
values for `[type]` are: `float`, `unfilterable_float`, `sint`, `uint` and
`depth`.

`@sampler_type [smp] [type]`: provides a sampler-type hint for the
sample named `smp`, corresponds with the sokol_gfx.h type `sg_sampler_type`
and the WebGPU type `WGPUSamplerBindingType`. Valid values for `[type]` are:
`filtering`, `nonfiltering` and `comparison`.

Those tags are only needed for `unfilterable_float / nonfiltering` texture/sampler
combinations (this is the only combination that can't be inferred from the shader
code). Unfilterable textures commonly have a floating point pixel format.

For instance in the [ozz-skin-sapp sampler shader code](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-samples/blob/master/sapp/ozz-skin-sapp.glsl), the skinning matrix texture and sampler need the following annoations:

```glsl
@image_sample_type joint_tex unfilterable_float
@sampler_type smp nonfiltering
uniform texture2D joint_tex;
uniform sampler smp;
```

Addition changes:

- Some type-to-string conversion result strings have changed for consistency,
  this may leak into the `bare_yaml` output files.
- A lot of the bind slot allocation and the 'reflection parsing' code has changed,
  and this area also has unfortunately become more complex, which result
  in more brittleness. This may result in new errors with non-trivial
  shader code. Please report any issues you encounter (https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/issues)

#### **16-Jul-2023**

> NOTE: this update is required for the [image/sampler object split in sokol-gfx](https://github.com/floooh/sokol/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#16-jul-2023), and in turn it doesn't work with older sokol-gfx versions (use the git tag `pre-separate-samplers` if you need to stick to the older version)

- input shader source code must now be written in Vulkan-GLSL-style with separate
  texture and sampler uniforms, this means that old code like this:

    ```glsl
    uniform sampler2D tex;

    void main() {
        frag_color = texture(tex, uv);
    }
    ```
  ...needs to be rewritten to look like this:

    ```glsl
    uniform texture2D tex;
    uniform sampler smp;

    void main() {
        frag_color = texture(sampler2D(tex, smp), uv);
    }
    ```

- the code-generation has been updated for the new 'separate image and sampler objects'
  sokol-gfx update
- sokol-shdc will now emit an error if it encounters 'old' OpenGL-GLSL-style code
  with combined image samplers
- the Google Tint library has been integrated to convert the SPIRV output from
  `glslang` to WGSL source code
- the output language option `wgpu` has been renamed to `wgsl`
- preliminary support for WGSL output has been added
- output for GLSL100 (GLES2) is still supported but has been deprecated

#### **09-Jul-2023**
- set CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to allow running sokol-shdc on older macOS versions

#### **01-Jul-2023**
- Nim backend: write addr() instead of deprecated unsafeAddr()

#### **08-Jun-2023**
- add a --save-intermediate-spirv cmdline option

#### **25-May-2023**
- update all Khronos dependencies to 1.3.246.1
- disable line directives for good

#### **24-May-2023**
- add a --nolinedirectives cmdline option which omits the #line debug mapping statements

#### **22-May-2023**
- update external dependencies to latest versions
- bump ios-metal version to 1.1 (1.0 is deprecated and doesn't fma() which
  is now emitted by SPIRVCross)

#### **18-Mar-2023**
- added a Rust backend (many thank to @ErikWDev!)

...

- **30-Jul-2022**:
    - BREAKING CHANGE: renamed the ```@cimport``` tag to ```@header```, and change behaviour so that
      it inserts the literal text after ```@header``` before the generated code (e.g. no more
      target-language specific behaviour)
    - Added an Odin code generator for the official Odin bindings (https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin)

- **14-Jun-2022**:
    - initial Nim support for use with the sokol-nim bindings
    - new tag: ```@cimport``` to pull in C headers, or Zig and Nim modules

- **07-Jan-2022**:
    - support for additional uniform types:
        - int => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_INT
        - ivec2 => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_INT2
        - ivec3 => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_INT3
        - ivec4 => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_INT4
    - add support for mixed-type uniform blocks, those will not be flattened
      for the output GLSL dialects
    - stricter checks for allowed types in uniform blocks (e.g. arrays
      are only allowed for vec4, ivec4 and mat4)

- **01-Jul-2021**:
    - A new command line option ```--reflection``` which adds a small set of
    runtime introspection functions to the generated code (currently only in the C
    code generator)
    - A new command line option ```--defines``` to pass a combination
      of preprocessor defines to the GLSL compilation pass, this can be
      used to stamp out different 'variations' from the same GLSL
      source file
    - A new command line option ```--module``` which allows to define or
      override the ```@module``` name from the command line. This is useful
      in combination with the new ```--defines``` option to make type-
      and function-names generated from the same source file unique.

- **10-Feb-2021**:
    - the C code generator has been updated for the latest API-breaking-changes
    in sokol_gfx.h
    - the generated function which returns an initialized sg_shader_desc struct
    now takes an input parameter to select the backend-specific code instead
    of calling the ```sg_query_backend()``` function
    - a code generator for the [sokol-zig bindings](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-zig/) has been
    added, used with ```--format sokol_zig```

- **03-Oct-2020**: The command line option ```--noifdef``` is now obsolete (but
  still accepted) and has been replaced with ```--ifdef```. The default
  behaviour is now to *not* wrap the generated platform specific code with
  ifdefs. If you rely on that behaviour, call sokol-shdc with the new
  ```--ifdef``` flag.
